# Hi, I'm Prashant 👋 💻

I'm an Application Security Engineer, cyber-security enhusiast and a computer techie! I love learning new technologies to solve my daily-life problems, make my life easier & more autonomous, coming up with new challenges and then, repeating the loop all over again. Highly inspired by Docker Captain Bret Fisher, I like to learn about technoligies like Docker and Cloud and their use to develop better and efficient software development lifecycles.
